👋 About Me

Salutacions, 👋 I'm @SamG05Z, a future network systems administrator currently honing my skills at Institut Pedralbes. While my focus is laser-sharp on the fascinating world of cybersecurity – think of me as a digital knight in shining armor, always ready to defend the network realm – my curiosity doesn't stop there. I'm also diving deep into the realms of containerization (Docker and Kubernetes are my playgrounds, and more like a torture room for the latter...), the vast expanse of cloud computing, the intricate SQL and database administration, the fundamental principles of networking, the art of system administration, and the power of scripting to automate just about anything.

💻 Technical Skills

My digital toolbox is constantly expanding! I have a genuine passion for scripting, wielding Python for backend wizardry and automation spells, Bash for those essential command-line incantations, and even a sprinkle of PowerShell for cross-platform adventures. On the web front, I'm navigating the foundational languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a foot in the door of PHP. You could say I'm aiming to be the IT equivalent of a Swiss Army knife – versatile and always ready for the task, even if some of the tools are still being sharpened!

🌱 Interests

My interests are as diverse as the tech landscape itself. I'm particularly drawn to the elegance of automation, the robustness of well-managed networks, the collaborative spirit of open-source projects, and the rewarding feeling of bridging language gaps through translation (whether it's Spanish, Catalan, or English).

🌐 Project Focus

Got a challenge in network management or a project screaming for automation? Count me in! I'm eager to contribute to open-source initiatives and even lend a hand in translation efforts. Whether it's crafting tools to monitor network health or experimenting with the magic of container orchestration, I thrive on learning by doing and tackling interesting problems head-on.

💞️ Collaboration

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts. I believe that the best solutions are often forged in the fires of shared knowledge and diverse perspectives. Plus, who doesn't appreciate a good laugh while wrestling with a particularly stubborn bug? 😅

📫 Connect With Me

Feel free to connect! You can reach me via email at samuel-ja@hotmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at @samg05x. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and embark on collaborative adventures that push the boundaries of what's possible.

😄 Some personal info & fun facts

⚡ Fun Fact #1: Ah, the joys of early experimentation! Let's just say my first attempt at dual booting ended with a rather intimate understanding of the boot partition removal process. It was a lesson learned the hard way, but a lesson nonetheless!
