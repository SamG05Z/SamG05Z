üëã About Me
Salutacions, üëã I'm @SamG05Z, a future network systems administrator currently honing my skills at Institut Pedralbes. While my focus is laser-sharp on the fascinating world of cybersecurity ‚Äì think of me as a digital knight in shining armor, always ready to defend the network realm ‚Äì my curiosity doesn't stop there. I'm also diving deep into the realms of containerization (Docker and Kubernetes are my playgrounds, and more like a torture room for the latter...), the vast expanse of cloud computing, the intricate SQL and database administration, the fundamental principles of networking, the art of system administration, and the power of scripting to automate just about anything.

üíª Technical Skills
My digital toolbox is constantly expanding! I have a genuine passion for scripting and automation, wielding Python for backend wizardry and automation spells, Bash for those essential command-line incantations, and even a sprinkle of PowerShell for cross-platform adventures.

When it comes to Operating Systems & System Administration, I'm proficient in both Linux and Windows environments, familiar with information representation, virtualization concepts, and managing Active Directory and LDAP for centralized identity. I've also gained experience in monitoring, auditing, and implementing unattended installations.

In the realm of Database Management, I have hands-on experience with MySQL and MariaDB, mastering advanced SQL operations (DDL, DQL, DML, DCL, TCL), implementing master-slave replication, and understanding Entity-Relationship and Relational models. I've also had an introduction to NoSQL, specifically MongoDB.

For Web Technologies & Development, I'm competent with foundational web structuring and styling using HTML and CSS. I can develop server-side web applications using PHP, integrating them with databases, and consuming/integrating with APIs. I'm also proficient with data serialization formats like JSON, YAML, and XML. Currently, I'm diligently expanding my front-end capabilities by learning JavaScript.

My expertise in Network Planning & Administration comes with practical experience configuring Routers and Switches (specifically with Cisco IOS). I possess a deep understanding of the OSI model, IPv4/IPv6, TCP/UDP, and subnetting, along with core network services like routing protocols, VLANs, port security, and NAT.

I also understand Computer Hardware fundamentals, including the Von Neumann architecture, and key components like CPU, RAM, Motherboard, PSU, etc., alongside insights into data center components and planning.

Beyond the basics, I'm well-versed in Network & Internet Services, configuring and understanding DHCP, DNS, Web Servers (HTTP, HTTPS), File Servers (FTP, SFTP, FTPS), and Mail Servers (SMTP, POP3, IMAP). I also have an awareness of various messaging protocols, audio codecs/containers, and video streaming fundamentals.

In the Cloud computing sphere, I have practical exposure to key AWS services including EC2, S3, EFS, EBS, CloudWatch, Lambda, ECS, EKS, and Elastic Load Balancers.

Finally, for Modern Deployment, I'm proficient in using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

You could say I'm aiming to be the IT equivalent of a Swiss Army knife ‚Äì versatile and always ready for the task, even if some of the tools are still being sharpened!

üå± Interests
My interests are as diverse as the tech landscape itself. I'm particularly drawn to the elegance of automation, the robustness of well-managed networks, the collaborative spirit of open-source projects, and the rewarding feeling of bridging language gaps through translation (whether it's Spanish, Catalan, or English).

üåê Project Focus
Got a challenge in network management or a project screaming for automation? Count me in! I'm eager to contribute to open-source initiatives and and lend a hand in translation efforts. Whether it's crafting tools to monitor network health or experimenting with the magic of container orchestration, I thrive on learning by doing and tackling interesting problems head-on.

üíûÔ∏è Collaboration
I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts. I believe that the best solutions are often forged in the fires of shared knowledge and diverse perspectives. Plus, who doesn't appreciate a good laugh while wrestling with a particularly stubborn bug? üòÖ

üì´ Connect With Me
Feel free to connect! You can reach me via email at samuel-ja@hotmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at @samg05x. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and embark on collaborative adventures that push the boundaries of what's possible.

üòÑ Some personal info & fun facts
Pronouns: He/Him

‚ö° Fun Fact #1: Ah, the joys of early experimentation! Let's just say my first attempt at dual booting ended with a rather intimate understanding of the boot partition removal process. It was a lesson learned the hard way, but a lesson nonetheless!
