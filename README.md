👋 Hi, I’m @SamG05Z and I am currently studying the **Higher Technician in Administration of Networking Systems** at Institut Pedralbes, specializing in Cybersecurity.

👀 I’m interested in collaborating on **security-focused software development projects**, particularly in areas like **web application security or network monitoring tools**. I'm also keen on contributing to **open-source projects** that align with my cybersecurity interests.

🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in **Python for scripting and backend development**, as well as building user interfaces with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I'm particularly interested in exploring frameworks like **Flask or Django (for Python)** and potentially diving into **React or Vue.js (for JavaScript)** in the future.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source cybersecurity tools, network automation scripts, or web applications with a strong emphasis on security**. I'm eager to contribute my growing Python skills, frontend knowledge, and understanding of network fundamentals to interesting projects. I'm also open to collaborating on projects related to **database management and automation**.

📫 You can reach me via **email at samuel-ja@hotmail.com** or connect with me on **LinkedIn at @samg05x**. Feel free to drop me a message!

⚡ Fun fact: I once accidentally took down my home network while experimenting with DHCP (don't worry, I fixed it!). It was a valuable learning experience in the importance of meticulous configuration!
